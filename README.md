# üìä Twitch Chat Bot and Analytics Dashboard #
### An all-in-one Twitch engagement and analytics project, built live on stream. https://twitch.tv/MitchsWorkshop ###  
  
Twitch has terrible anlytics. The .csv file you can download from your creator dashboard is dirty, doesn't include the title of the stream or the category of the stream, and is generally unhelpful from a business standpoint. Plus, the average user doesn't have the skillset required to visualize that data to gain their own insights. Relying on Twitch to provide business guidance has simply never worked. I wanted something better, so I'm building it.  
  
## ü§ñ Using the bot ##  
Currently, there is a working custom chat bot that requires users to create a `credentials.env` file and pass in the account name of their bot, its Client ID (recieved from the Twitch developer portal https://dev.twitch.tv/api/), and an OAuth token (also from Twitch https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/getting-tokens-oauth). The bot will run with some default commands, and users can add, edit, or delete their own with `!addcommand`, `!editcommand` (in progress), and `!delcommand` (also in progress).  
  
## üñ• Data Gathering ##  
The bot will store data in a SQLite database called `data.db` which is created by the bot at startup. It stores every message sent (the sender and the time of sending, not the content of the message), and every command used. In the works is the ability to track per-minute viewership, average view time per viwer, whether or not those viewers are followers/subscribers, and who is chatting or not. This will help content creators focus their efforts where they are weakest. Additional insights about stream length, title, average viewership, new followers/subscribers, cheers, tips, and other data points will also be included.  
  
## üìà Data Visualization ##  
Most content creators aren't programmers or data scientists (and neither am I), so expecting them to use their data to form their own insights is unreasonable. To alleviate that, there will be a web-based, real-time data visualization dashboard built with Dash (https://plotly.com/dash/). Sliders, checkboxes, and dropdowns will make it easy for streamers to gain tailored and specific insights built especially for them.  
  
## üè° Hosted Locally. Your Data is Yours. ##  
Since all of the data is stored locally, you can be confident in the persistance of your data. Keep in mind, however, no one can hide Twitch data from Twitch itself. Still, there is no need to rely on third party bots like StreamElements or StreamLabs to gain access to your chat data, and you won't have to slog through Twitch's terrible analytics process. The data is all yours, in real time. No programming knowedge required.  
  
## üé• Built On Stream ##  
The project is currently in its infancy, but the chat bot and database are functioning alongside an early build of the Dash web app. If you want to see the progress being made live, feel free to come by my own Twitch channel to ask questions or comment on the code (https://twitch.tv/MitchsWorkshop). When I'm offline, feel free to reach out on the Workshop Discord Server (https://discord.gg/7nefPK6) and offer up your questions, comments, critiques, or feature proposals. There are a couple hundred people in there who love to help each other with problems or give programming advice. It's a fun place that I'm proud of. Thanks, friends!
